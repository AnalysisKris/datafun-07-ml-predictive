# Project 7


### Task 3 

 
    This repository employs a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model using all available data and use the resulting model (a best-fit straight line) to make predictions.

    Follwing Sections 10.16 and 15.4 of Deitel, Paul; Deitel, Harvey M.. Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science. Pearson Education., simple linear regression is performed on a  small weather data time series using pandas, Seaborn’s regplot function and the SciPy’s  stats module’s linregress function. 


### Task 5 BONUS 

    Section 15.5 of the text is followed to perform linear regression with a  much larger real-world dataset, the California Housing dataset; bundled with scikit-learn, which contains 20,640 samples, each  with eight numerical features. Multiple linear regression using all eight  numerical features is conducted to make more sophisticated housing price predictions and more meaningful results opposed to those derived from simple linear regression of individual features. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to visualize some of the data.
